# Donation instead disposal 
This simple web app will be a space where anyone can give away their no longer needed things to someone else who may need it. 
## MVP
The main goal of this web app will be to provide very user-friendly detailed form, where one can: 
1. Describe what kinds of things are to be donated.
2. Pick a desired charity where donation can be made.
3. Order a courier to given place at given time.
## Complete functionality
In the final application shape, following functionalities are planned to be implemented:
- User panel
	- logged users will have their whole donation history preserved.
- Charities current status
- Admin role with admin panel:
	- Promote other admins
	- Manage (CRUD) logged users
	- Manage (CRUD) institutions
	- Aggregate view of all charities.
